$CLOUD_LONG is a cloud-based PostgreSQL platform for resource-intensive workloads. We help you build faster, 
scale further, and stay under budget. A $SERVICE_LONG is a single optimized 100% PostgreSQL database instance that you 
use as is, or extend with capabilities specific to your business needs. The available capabilities are:

- **[Time-series and analytics][create-service]**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB. The PostgreSQL you know and love, 
   supercharged with functionality for storing and querying [time-series data][what-is-time-series] at scale for 
   analytics and other use cases.
   Get faster time-based queries with hypertables, continuous aggregates, and columnar storage. Save on storage with 
   native compression, data retention policies, and bottomless data tiering to Amazon S3. 
- **[AI and vector][create-service]**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions. Use PostgreSQL as a vector database with 
   purpose built extensions for building AI applications from start to scale. Get fast and accurate similarity search 
   with the pgvector and pgvectorscale extensions. Create vector embeddings and perform LLM reasoning on your data with 
   the pgai extension.
- **[PostgreSQL][create-service]**: the trusted industry-standard RDBMS. Ideal for applications requiring strong data 
   consistency, complex relationships, and advanced querying capabilities. Get ACID compliance, extensive SQL support, 
   JSON handling, and extensibility through custom functions, data types, and extensions. $CLOUD_LONG continuously 
   monitors your services and prevents common PostgreSQL out-of-memory crashes. 

All $SERVICE_LONGs include the tooling you expect for production and developer environments: [live migration][live-migration], 
[automatic backups and PITR][automatic-backups], [high availability][high-availability], [read replicas][readreplica], [data forking][operations-forking], [connection pooling][connection-pooling], [tiered storage][data-tiering], 
[usage-based storage][how-plans-work], secure in-Console [SQL editing][in-console-editors], service [metrics][metrics] 
and [insights][insights],&nbsp;[streamlined maintenance][maintain-upgrade],&nbsp;and much more.
